## The person

J. Shamsul Bahri believes that talking in third-person is necessary when writing an about page. He is a
software engineer from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia currently living and working in Singapore. A husband to a
beautiful wife, a father to an adorable daughter, and a seeker of knowledge.

He does not believe in "eat, sleep, code and repeat." While he is passionate about writing code and equally
passionate about both eating and sleeping, that is not all that he does. He plays video games, read comics,
drinks coffee, watches movies, listens to music, builds mechanical keyboards, and other random super cool
stuff.
